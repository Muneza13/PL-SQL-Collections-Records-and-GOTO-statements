# PL-SQL-Collections-Records-and-GOTO-statements
Overview

This repository demonstrates PL/SQL Collections, Records, and GOTO statements through a single, coherent problem: processing and grading student quiz scores with category aggregation, business-rules validation, and exceptional control flow.

The deliverables in the repo:

1. DDL to create schema objects (tables and sample data)

2. PL/SQL package and procedures that use collections, records, and GOTO

3. Test scripts and expected output

Problem definition (explicit)

Designing  a PL/SQL solution for a tutoring center that accepts many quiz submissions per student and:

Aggregates quiz scores by student and by category (e.g., MATH, ENGLISH, SCIENCE).

Calculates per-student final score, weighted by category weights stored in a table.

Detects invalid scores (< 0 or > 100) and uses a GOTO controlled error-handling label to skip the offending record while recording an error row into an errors table.

Uses Records to model each input row and Collections to hold intermediate aggregates and to produce a final sorted student report.

Exposes a packaged API to: load data, process/aggregate, produce a report table, and cleanup.

DDL(data definition languague) created tables are 
Students, quiz submissions, category weights, and errors

CREATE TABLE students (
student_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
full_name VARCHAR2(200)
);


CREATE TABLE quiz_submissions (
submission_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
student_id NUMBER NOT NULL,
category VARCHAR2(50),
score NUMBER,
taken_on DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);


CREATE TABLE category_weights (
category VARCHAR2(50) PRIMARY KEY,
weight NUMBER -- percentage as decimal (e.g. 0.4 for 40%)
);


CREATE TABLE processing_errors (
error_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
submission_id NUMBER,
student_id NUMBER,
msg VARCHAR2(4000),
logged_on DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);


CREATE TABLE student_reports (
student_id NUMBER,
full_name VARCHAR2(200),
final_score NUMBER,
notes VARCHAR2(400)
);
